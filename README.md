# iamdenton
I'm Denton, a software engineer who's worked on everything from offline CBDC payments to fintech modeling tools. Always down to chat about tech, projects, or honestly whatever, feel free to reach out.

This is my portfolio disguised as a retro Windows XP-style operating system. Built with React and TypeScript, it's got working windows you can drag around, a couple games to kill time, and all my work stuff organized into desktop apps. It's probably more fun than a regular resume site.
