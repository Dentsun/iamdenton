# Gamified Portfolio Website

An interactive 2D platformer that lets visitors explore my personal website through game mechanics — built with **Phaser 3** and **Vite**.

## Tech Stack

- **Phaser 3** – 2D game engine (physics, input, scenes)
- **Vite** – lightning-fast dev server & bundler
- **TypeScript / JavaScript** – core game logic
- **HTML/CSS** – overlays and styling for UI sections
- **Vercel** – static hosting

## Project Structure



2. File & Folder Structure
   Keep files short and focused (100–250 lines preferred), add helper files to keep this low. 
   There may be exceptions, use your own discretion.
